        <p>
            Statistics has become an integral part of research in medicine and biology, and the tools for sum-
            marizing data and drawing inferences from data are essential both for understanding the out-
            comes of studies and for incorporating measures of uncertainty into that understanding. This
            course provides an introduction to statistical methods, covering elementary probability theory,
            foundations of inference, and other fundamental techniques. Statistical methods will be moti-
            vated through simulation and data analysis instead of theory.</p>
